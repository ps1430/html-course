      <pre>Python     is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use 
        of significant indentation.Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" 
        language due to its comprehensive standard library.In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used 
        to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a 
        placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which 
        <br><br>
        allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
        Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman
        and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
        Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by 
        advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, 
        when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker.
        <br><br> 
        Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,as have many LaTeX pac
        web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.Guido van Rossum began working on 
        Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python.
        Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, 
        reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible 
        with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.the Senate seat occupied by Matthew Quay, the state's Republican political boss. Quay sought election to a third term, but was damaged by an indictment for financial irregularities. Although Republicans had a majority in the legislature, enough were opposed to Quay to deny him re-election. After 79 ballots, the session ended on April 20, the day Quay was acquitted, without the election of a senator. Governor William A. Stone appointed Quay to the seat, but the Senate refused to seat him. Quay blamed his fellow Republican boss, Senator Mark Hanna of Ohio, for this and revenged himself at the 1900 Republican National Convention by backing Thomas C. Platt's scheme to politically sideline Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York by making him vice president, over Hanna's strong objection. The 1901 legislature elected Quay to the Senate and he served there until his death in 1904. (Fu
