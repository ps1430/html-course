Quay sought election to a third term, but was damaged by an indictment for financial irregularities. Although Republicans had a majority in the legislature, enough were opposed to Quay to deny him re-election. After 79 ballots, the session ended on April 20, the day Quay was acquitted, without the election of a senator. Governor William A. Stone appointed Quay to the seat, but the Senate refused to seat him. Quay blamed his fellow Republican boss, Senator Mark Hanna of Ohio, for this and revenged himself at the 1900 Republican National Convention by backing Thomas C. Platt's scheme to politically sideline Governor Theodore Roosevelt of New York by making him vice president, over Hanna's strong objection. The 1901 legislature elected Quay to the Senate and he served there until his death in 1904. (Fu

      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data 
        structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well
        as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax 
        emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages
        program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form
        without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the 
        increased productivity it provides.

        <p>Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging 
        Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an 
        error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level
         debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping 
         through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective 
         power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast 
         edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.See also some comparisons between Python and other languages.</p>
